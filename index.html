    <h1> Welcome to my first Website</h1>
    <p> Today I am going to talk about my first week experience at <b>AkiraChix</b>.<span style="border-color: chocolate; border:2px solid;">So far I am enjoying my stay here, I have got to meet alot of amazing people and learnt different culures.</span></p>
    <h2 style="color:blueviolet;">Things I did not like</h2>
    <p>Back home in Ethiopia, we are not accustomed to eating roasted or boiled bananas; we only eat raw bananas when they are ripe.
    Therefore, the following food types have a different taste for me.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Matoke</li>
        <li>Boiled bananas</li>
    </ul>
